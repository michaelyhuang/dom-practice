<!--
    Challenges:
    a <p> with red text that says “Hey I’m red!”
    an <h3> with blue text that says “I’m a blue h3!”
    a <div> with a black border and pink background color with the following elements inside of it:
        another <h1> that says “I’m in a div”
        a <p> that says “ME TOO!”
        Hint for this one: after creating the div with createElement, append the <h1> and <p> to it before adding it to the container.
